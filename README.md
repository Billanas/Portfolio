**Overview**

This project is a comprehensive analysis of liquor sales in the state of Iowa, USA, spanning from 2012 to 2020. The objective is to identify **the most popular liquor items by zipcode** and **calculate the percentage of sales per store** within the years 2016-2019. The entire workflow, from data extraction to visualization, is performed using SQL, Python, Matplotlib, and Tableau.

**Overview**

This project aims to develop a powerful Power BI dashboard. The goal is to offer analytics on inventory status, sales performance, and stock management through a series of advanced visualizations and calculations.


**ABC Classification Line Graph:**
 <br/>
A key feature is the ABC Classification line graph, which distinctly illustrates the percentage share of products categorized into high, medium, and low value groups, offering a clear view of product value distribution.


**Combined ABC and XYZ Classification Matrices:**
 <br/>
Three matrices integrate ABC and XYZ classifications, providing detailed insights into:
The Distribution of Annual Revenue.
The Distribution of Current Stock.
The Distribution of Inventory Turnover Ratio.



**In-depth Calculations:**
 <br/>
The dashboard includes crucial calculations for:
The Inventory Turnover Ratio Index.
The current valuation of items in the warehouse.
The total number of SKUs (stock-keeping units).

**Stock Status Doughnut Chart:**
 <br/>
A doughnut chart displays stock status, categorizing products as “below the reorder point”, “in stock”, and “out of stock”, for direct inventory assessment.

**Gauge Chart for SKU Reordering:**
 <br/>
The gauge chart effectively indicates the quantity of SKUs to reorder. 

**Revenue and Quantity Flow Line Charts with Forecasting:**
 <br/>
The project features line charts that not only track the revenue and quantity flow but also provide a forecast for five subsequent periods, aiding in predictive analysis.

**Comprehensive Inventory Metrics:**
 <br/>
A metric display offers a complete overview of current stock quantity, average lead time in days, reorder point, safety stock, and stock status, providing a quick snapshot of essential inventory metrics.

**Overview**


This project aims to analyze and visualize career track data to gain insights into employee demographics, management distribution, salary trends, and gender pay gaps. The project consists of four main components:

**Gender Breakdown**

This component analyzes the gender distribution of employees within the specified time period. It calculates the percentage of female and male employees.

**Management Distribution**

This component examines the distribution of managers across different departments. It determines the number of managers per department for the given time period.

**Average Annual Salary**

This component calculates the average annual salary of all employees for the specified time period. It provides a summary of the average salary and its distribution across the employee population.

**Gender Pay Gap Analysis**

This component investigates potential pay gaps between male and female employees. It calculates the average employee salary by gender and department, identifying any discrepancies in compensation levels.

**Overview**

In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, to create a predictive model for crude oil prices. The model is trained using historical monthly data.
To see the project on GitHub click [(here)](https://github.com/Billanas/Crude-Oil-Price-WTI-Prediction-TensorFlow).


**Model Architecture**

The predictive model utilizes a deep learning approach, employing a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow. The model consists of multiple layers, allowing it to learn complex patterns and correlations in the data.

# A/B Testing for Conversion Rate Optimization
<br/>

**Overview**

In this project, I conducted an A/B test to optimize conversion rates for a website, focusing on the effectiveness of different call-to-action (CTA) button wording. The experiment compared two variants: Variant A ("Sign Up Now!") and Variant B ("Get Started for Free!"), aiming to uncover which CTA phrase better motivates users to sign up.


**Analysis and Findings** 
 <br/>
The statistical analysis employed a two-proportion z-test, revealing a p-value of 0.034. This result indicates a statistically significant difference between the conversion rates of the two variants, with Variant B showing superior performance. Specifically, the coefficients—representing the conversion rates—were 4.6% for Variant A and 6.8% for Variant B. The lower p-value than the conventional alpha level of 0.05 underscores the reliability of our findings, suggesting that the difference in conversion rates is not due to random chance.
 <br/>
  <br/>
**Outcome and Decision**
Based on the statistical evidence, Variant B ("Get Started for Free!") was chosen as the optimal CTA. This decision is grounded in its higher conversion rate, which demonstrates its effectiveness in engaging users and prompting actions.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simulation-based approach to forecast Duolingo's stock price. By employing the Monte Carlo method, we can generate multiple potential scenarios and analyze the potential range of outcomes.

**Introduction**

In this project, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Duolingo's stock to assess its risk and expected return. By calculating beta, we can evaluate the stock's sensitivity to market movements. Additionally, we apply the CAPM to estimate the appropriate required return for holding Duolingo's stock. To see the project on GitHub click [(here)](https://github.com/Billanas/Duolingo-Stock-Analysis-Beta-CAPM).

**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

The CAPM allows us to estimate the expected return of Duolingo's stock based on its beta and the risk-free rate of return. By incorporating both systematic and unsystematic risk factors, the CAPM provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the stock's potential returns.

**Overview**

This project divided in three challenges. In the challenge 1, the task of analyzing data about client profitability using pivot tables was undertaken. A pivot table was created to display the monthly breakdown of gross profit, revenue, and COGS by client. This facilitated the identification of the most profitable client accounts. The challenge 2 involved completing the income statement, profit and loss statement, and balance sheet for the last year's transactions. The challenge 3 involved calculations of residual debt and present value.  To see the project on GitHub click [(here)](https://github.com/Billanas/Complete_Financial_Project_in_Excel).
