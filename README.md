# [Crude-Oil-Price-WTI-Prediction-TensorFlow] (https://github.com/Billanas/Crude-Oil-Price-WTI-Prediction-TensorFlow)

**Overview**

In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, to create a predictive model for crude oil prices. The model is trained using historical monthly data.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project was retrieved from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) and covers the period from January 1 - 2010, to May 1 - 2023. 

**Model Architecture**

The predictive model utilizes a deep learning approach, employing a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow. The model consists of multiple layers, allowing it to learn complex patterns and correlations in the data.

**Usage**

To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Python, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided notebook).
Prepare your own dataset or use the provided example dataset.
Execute the code in the Jupyter notebook or Python script provided.
Explore the results and evaluate the performance of the model.
