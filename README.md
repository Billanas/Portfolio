**Overview**

In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, to create a predictive model for crude oil prices. The model is trained using historical monthly data.

**Model Architecture**

The predictive model utilizes a deep learning approach, employing a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow. The model consists of multiple layers, allowing it to learn complex patterns and correlations in the data.

**Introduction**

In this project, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Duolingo's stock to assess its risk and expected return. By calculating beta, we can evaluate the stock's sensitivity to market movements. Additionally, we apply the CAPM to estimate the appropriate required return for holding Duolingo's stock.

**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

The CAPM allows us to estimate the expected return of Duolingo's stock based on its beta and the risk-free rate of return. By incorporating both systematic and unsystematic risk factors, the CAPM provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the stock's potential returns.

 Average Return Calculation for Canadian National Railway Stock Price for past 27 years. The main objective of this project is to analyze the historical stock price data of CNI and calculate the average return for 27 years period. The average return is a key metric used to assess the profitability and volatility of an investment.
