**Overview**

In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, to create a predictive model for crude oil prices. The model is trained using historical monthly data.

**Model Architecture**

The predictive model utilizes a deep learning approach, employing a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow. The model consists of multiple layers, allowing it to learn complex patterns and correlations in the data.
