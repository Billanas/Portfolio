**Overview**

In this project, we leverage the power of TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, to create a predictive model for crude oil prices. The model is trained using historical monthly data.
To see the project on github click [(here)](https://github.com/Billanas/Crude-Oil-Price-WTI-Prediction-TensorFlow).


**Model Architecture**

The predictive model utilizes a deep learning approach, employing a neural network architecture implemented with TensorFlow. The model consists of multiple layers, allowing it to learn complex patterns and correlations in the data.

The purpose of this project is to provide a simulation-based approach to forecast Duolingo's stock price. By employing the Monte Carlo method, we can generate multiple potential scenarios and analyze the potential range of outcomes.

**Introduction**

In this project, we perform a comprehensive analysis of Duolingo's stock to assess its risk and expected return. By calculating beta, we can evaluate the stock's sensitivity to market movements. Additionally, we apply the CAPM to estimate the appropriate required return for holding Duolingo's stock. To see the project on github click [(here)](https://github.com/Billanas/Duolingo-Stock-Analysis-Beta-CAPM).

**Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**

The CAPM allows us to estimate the expected return of Duolingo's stock based on its beta and the risk-free rate of return. By incorporating both systematic and unsystematic risk factors, the CAPM provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the stock's potential returns.

 Average Return Calculation for Canadian National Railway Stock Price for past 27 years. The main objective of this project is to analyze the historical stock price data of CNI and calculate the average return for 27 years period. The average return is a key metric used to assess the profitability and volatility of an investment.

**Overview**

This project is a comprehensive analysis of liquor sales in the state of Iowa, USA, spanning from 2012 to 2020. The objective is to identify **the most popular liquor items by zipcode** and **calculate the percentage of sales per store** within the years 2016-2019. The entire workflow, from data extraction to visualization, is performed using SQL, Python, Matplotlib, and Tableau.

**Overview**

This project divided in three challenges. In the challenge 1, the task of analyzing data about client profitability using pivot tables was undertaken. A pivot table was created to display the monthly breakdown of gross profit, revenue, and COGS by client. This facilitated the identification of the most profitable client accounts. The challenge 2 involved completing the income statement, profit and loss statement, and balance sheet for the last year's transactions. The challenge 3 involved calculations of residual debt and present value.  To see the project on github click [(here)](https://github.com/Billanas/Complete_Financial_Project_in_Excel).
